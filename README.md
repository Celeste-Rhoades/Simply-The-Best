## About

I built Simply The Best because I was sick of losing all the recommendations I'd gotten from friends. I wanted a single place where I could store everything, have it be organized and easy to find.

The idea of seeing what my friends loved really excited me, so I built it as a social platform where we could exchange recommendations and discover what each other are into. Building it from the ground up was a lot of fun. I got to decide exactly what features I wanted and build it to work the way I envisioned.

The result is a platform that works exactly how I want it to, and I'm proud of how it turned out.
